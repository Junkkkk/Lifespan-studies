# Lifespan-studies

This repository contains the codebase for conducting lifespan studies using Martingale residual GWAS, burden tests, and SKAT-O tests. The repository is organized into three main folders, each addressing a specific aspect of the study.

## Folder Structure

### 1. Martingale Residuals

This folder contains scripts to compute Martingale residuals, adjust them for relatedness and population structure, and prepare phenotypes for downstream GWAS and burden tests.

### 2. Common Variants Studies

This folder focuses on GWAS analyses for common variants using linear mixed models.

### 3. Rare Variants Studies

This folder contains scripts for gene-based rare variant association studies using SKAT-O and burden tests.
